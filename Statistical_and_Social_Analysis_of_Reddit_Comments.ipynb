Dass es eine Protestbewegung gibt, die sich für die Durchsetzung bestehender Gesetze einsetzt, ist schon erstaunlich genug.\\n\\nEhemalige Schulkamaraden, die jetzt in Dresden studieren, habe ich mal über die Weihnachtsferien ausgefragt, was da so für Leute rumrennen. Und nach deren Einschätzung, sind das politisch desillusionierte Leute, die aber genau wissen, was in der Welt vor sich geht (natürlich nicht alle). Sie wissen einiges über die Weltpolitik der letzten 30-40 Jahre und haben eine gewisse Ahnung von Geopolitik, zumindest mehr als man in Deutschland erfährt, wenn man sich nur berieseln lässt.\\n\\nViele Rentner waren auch schon 89 auf der Straße und verspüren einen ähnlichen Geist wie damals. Der Unterschied zu damals ist, dass man anhand der Strukturen schon den Unrechtsstaat der DDR erkennen konnte, während das heutige System besser darin ist Freiheit vorzutäuschen. Denk- und Äußerungsverbote werden nicht mehr mit Haft bestraft, sondern mit Hinrichtung durch die Nazi/Antisemitenkeule etc.\\n\\nViele sind auch von den ehemaligen Bürgerrechtlern enttäuscht, die nun, da sie einen sicheren und gutdotierten Posten haben, plötzlich nicht mehr gegen das System sind, sondern wie die Parteibonzen damals als Profiteure die Demonstrierenden verteufeln und die Ungerechtigkeiten einfach wegdenken.\\n\\nIch persönlich finde die Bewegung gut, da sie zeigt, wie sehr sich die Politik vom gemeinen Volk entfernt hat, dass sich die Medien in ihren Hassabsonderungen geradezu unterbieten, was Niveau, Arbeitsethik und Einfältigkeit angeht. Die Kirche hetzt gegen die, denen sie eigentlich helfen will, die sozial benachteiligten und Arme. Dadurch konnte ich endlich aus dem Verein aussteigen und dem geiferndem Pastor zu Weihnachten ordentlich die Meinung geigen.\\n\\nDas Urkomische an dieser Bewegung ist, dass die ganzen Kritiker bis jetzt noch kein haltbares Argument gegen das Positionspapier hervorbringen konnten, aber erstmal herumblubbern, beleidigen und ad-personam-Attacken fahren.

Objektiv gesehen ist die Oppositionsarbeit nun auch einfach nicht gut: Radikal destruktiv statt konstruktiv, hysterisch statt nüchtern.
